**It's here, the whole world is in 2024** 🎉 🌎🌍🌏

After New Year's Eve, many fireworks, beautiful shows and hateful comments on the SK/CZ scene, we dive into the year 2024. I wish you all a great start to the new year, that your resolutions will come true and I believe that this year will be even better than the last one. Thank you so much to everyone who watched our live stream, which I did with my friend [JopGamer](https://github.com/JopGamer), who also hosted the whole thing. Thank you to everyone here on the server and to everyone I spent the last moments of 2023 with.

I created [Hyro's Coffee](https://s.xhyrom.dev/discord) server 27 November 2022 22:14 and we also spent the last moments of 2022 here. I hope to see you here again next year and have a lot of fun during the year not only calling but also writing.

This place has become a universal place. We deal with all kinds of things here, there are different people here, and everyone is special in some way and that's what fulfils us people.

Stay healthy and enjoy life with family and friends. It doesn't matter how you do it but the important thing is that you do it.
